We are going to be building a raspberry pi python app for FRC that counts the number of balls transitioning through four channels of a ball return system.  Our goal is to count the number of balls that go through each channel.  This will be representing by a GPIO pin flipping from high to low (or similar, let's add a layer of indirection, low may indicate a steady state).  We want to integrate with the FRC WPILib networks tables library to publish an aggregate count.  Ideally we want to also listen to network tables for transitions between match phases and for match timings.  The team number is 6328, and network tables will be on a robot located at at configurable address.  We will have two WS2813 led strips with 6 directly addressible LEDs each.  When a shot is counted, we want to pulse it red.  When a the total number of shots exceed 100, we want to change the color of the pulse to yellow.  At 360 the color should shift to blue.  Finally, we want a simple webserver embedded that serves a single page appliaction.  The single page app will communicate with the hub counter service using rest, and will have a dashboard showing the current number of balls detected through each channel, the aggregate ball count, a reset ball count button, as well as a config screen to set the time number and colors / threholds for flashing.
