# Simulation GUI Configuration

The JSON files in this folder provide a default configuration for WPILib's simulation GUI, including docked windows and keyboard mapping for Xbox and override controllers. To use these layouts, **copy the three JSON files to the root directory of the robot project**. Open the `Simulation Key Mapping.html` file in a browser to see the default key mappings for `Keyboard 0` (Xbox) and `Keyboard 1` (overrides).
